# cm
Modern CMake project generator.

This application provides a command line tool, `cm`, which enables users to generate and manage projects using C++ and modern CMake-based build systems.

It is based on `cmake-init`, a project template for modern CMake
(https://github.com/cginternals/cmake-init), using its components as
templates for automatically generating cmake projects using a CLI.

`cm` is written in Python3.
